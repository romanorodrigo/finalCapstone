## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu that allows you to choose between the investment calculator and the home loan repayment calculator. 

### Investment Calculator

If you select the investment calculator, you will be prompted to enter the amount of money to deposit, the interest rate, and the number of years you plan to invest. 
After providing these inputs, you can choose between two interest options: 'simple' or 'compound'. 

- Simple interest: Interest is calculated only once per year on the initial amount invested.
- Compound interest: Interest is calculated on the accumulated amount over time.

The program will then calculate and display the total amount based on the selected interest option.

### Home Loan Repayment Calculator

If you choose the home loan repayment calculator, you need to enter the actual value of the house, the interest rate, and the number of months you plan to repay the bond. 
The program will calculate and display the monthly payment amount.
